String Functions

Python contains many useful built-in functions and methods to accomplish common tasks.
join - joins a list of strings with another string as a separator.
replace - replaces one substring in a string with another.
startswith and endswith - determine if there is a substring at the start and end of a string, respectively.
To change the case of a string, you can use lower and upper.
The method split is the opposite of join turning a string with a certain separator into a list.
