Decorators:

Decorators provide a way to modify functions using other functions.
This is ideal when you need to extend the functionality of functions that you don't want to modify.


Python provides support to wrap a function in
a decorator by pre-pending the function definition with a decorator name and the @ symbol.


!!! A single function can have multiple decorators.
