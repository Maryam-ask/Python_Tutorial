Comments:

Comments are annotations to code used to make it easier to understand.
They don't affect how code is run.


!!! In Python, a comment is created by inserting an octothorpe (otherwise known as a number sign or hash symbol: #).
All text after it on that line is ignored.

!!!!  Unlike programming languages such as C, Python doesn’t have general purpose multiline comments.

Docstrings:

Docstrings (documentation strings) are similar to comments, in that they’re designed to explain code.
But! they’re more specific and have a different syntax.

They’re created by putting a multiline string containing an explanation of the function below the function's first line.


!!! Unlike conventional comments,
    docstrings are retained throughout the runtime of the program.
    This allows the programmer to inspect these comments at run time.
