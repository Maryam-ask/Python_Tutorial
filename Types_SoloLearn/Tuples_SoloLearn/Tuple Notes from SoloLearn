Tuples:


Tuples are very similar to lists, except that they are immutable (they cannot be changed).
Also, they are created using parentheses, rather than square brackets.

    words = ("spam", "eggs", "sausages",)


You can access the values in the tuple with their index, just as you did with lists:

    print(word[0])



Trying to reassign a value in a tuple causes a TypeError.
    words[1] = "cheese"


!!! Tuples are faster than lists, but they cannot be changed.
