Class Methods:


Methods of objects we've looked at so far are called by an instance of a class,
which is then passed to the self parameter of the method.

Class methods are different - they are called by a class, which is passed to the cls parameter of the method.

A common use of these are factory methods, which instantiate an instance of a class,
using different parameters than those usually passed to the class constructor.

Class methods are marked with a classmethod decorator.
