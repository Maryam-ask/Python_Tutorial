Methods:


Classes can have other methods defined to add functionality to them.
Remember, that all methods must have self as their first parameter.
These methods are accessed using the same dot syntax as attributes.


Classes can also have class attributes, created by assigning variables within the body of the class.
These can be accessed either from instances of the class, or the class itself.
