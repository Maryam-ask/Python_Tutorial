Inheritance:


Inheritance provides a way to share functionality between classes.


Imagine several classes, Cat, Dog, Rabbit and so on.
Although they may differ in some ways (only Dog might have the method bark),
they are likely to be similar in others (all having the attributes color and name).

Superclass:

A class that inherits from another class is called a subclass.
A class that is inherited from is called a superclass.
If a class inherits from another with the same attributes or methods, it overrides them.

This similarity can be expressed by making them all inherit from a superclass Animal,
which contains the shared functionality.

To inherit a class from another class, put the superclass name in parentheses after the class name.
