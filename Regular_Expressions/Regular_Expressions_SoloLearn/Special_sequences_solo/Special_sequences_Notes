Special Sequences:


There are various special sequences you can use in regular expressions.
They are written as a backslash followed by another character.
One useful special sequence is a backslash and a number between 1 and 99, e.g., \1 or \17.
This matches the expression of the group of that number.

More useful special sequences are \d, \s, and \w.
These match digits, whitespace, and word characters respectively.
In ASCII mode they are equivalent to [0-9], [ \t\n\r\f\v], and [a-zA-Z0-9_].
In Unicode mode they match certain other characters, as well. For instance, \w matches letters with accents.
Versions of these special sequences with upper case letters - \D, \S, and \W - mean the opposite to the lower-case versions.
For instance, \D matches anything that isn't a digit.

Additional special sequences are \A, \Z, and \b.
The sequences \A and \Z match the beginning and end of a string, respectively.
The sequence \b matches the empty string between \w and \W characters, or \w characters and the beginning or end of the string. Informally, it represents the boundary between words.
The sequence \B matches the empty string anywhere else.
