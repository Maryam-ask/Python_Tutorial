Email Extraction


To demonstrate a sample usage of regular expressions, lets create a program to extract email addresses from a string.
 we have a text that contains an email address:

    str = "Please contact info@sololearn.com for assistance"


Our goal is to extract the substring "info@sololearn.com".
A basic email address consists of a word and may include dots or dashes.
This is followed by the @ sign and the domain name (the name, a dot, and the domain name suffix).
This is the basis for building our regular expression.

    pattern =r"([\W\.-]+)@([\W\.-]+)(\-[\W\.]+)"

[\w\.-]+   ----> Matches one or more word character, dor or dash.

Our regex contains three groups:
1 - first part of the email address.    ([\w\.-]+)
2 - domain name without the suffix.     ([\w\.-]+)
3 - the domain suffix.                  (\.[\w\.]+)


The regex above says that the string should contain a word (with dots and dashes allowed),
followed by the @ sign, then another similar word, then a dot and another word.
