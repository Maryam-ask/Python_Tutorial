Reusing Code:

Code reuse is a very important part of programming in any language.

For a large programming project to be successful,
it is essential to abide by the Don't Repeat Yourself, or DRY, principle.

!!! Bad, repetitive code is said to abide by the WET principle,
     which stands for Write Everything Twice, or We Enjoy Typing.
