String Formatting:

So far, to combine strings and non-strings, you've converted the non-strings to strings and added them.
String formatting provides a more powerful way to embed non-strings within strings.
String formatting uses a string's format method to substitute a number of arguments in the string.

!! Each argument of the format function is placed in the string at the corresponding position,
        which is determined using the curly braces { }.
