Python Classes/Objects:
Python is an object oriented programming language.
Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

*************************************************************************************
The __init__() Function:
To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties,
or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created

!!! The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.

*************************************************************************************
The self Parameter:
The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class,
and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like,
but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class
