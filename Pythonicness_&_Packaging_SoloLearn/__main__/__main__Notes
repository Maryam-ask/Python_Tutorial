__main__


Most Python code is either a module to be imported, or a script that does something.
However, sometimes it is useful to make a file that can be both imported as a module and run as a script.
To do this, place script code inside if __name__ == "__main__".
This ensures that it won't be run if the file is imported.

If we save the code from our previous example as a file called sololearn.py,
we can then import it to another script as a module, using the name sololearn.
