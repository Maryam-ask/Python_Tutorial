else


The else statement is most commonly used along with the if statement,
but it can also follow a for or while loop, which gives it a different meaning.
With the for or while loop, the code within it is called if the loop finishes normally
(when a break statement does not cause an exit from the loop).

The else statement can also be used with try/except statements.
In this case, the code within it is only executed if no error occurs in the try statement.
