Finally:

To ensure some code runs no matter what errors occur, you can use a finally statement.

the finally statement is placed at the bottom of a try/except statement.

!! Code within a finally statement always runs after execution of the code in try and possible in the except, blocks.

Code in a finally statement even runs if an uncaught exception occurs in one of the preceding blocks.
