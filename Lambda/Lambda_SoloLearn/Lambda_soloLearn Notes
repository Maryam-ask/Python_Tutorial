Lambda:

Creating a function normally (using def) assigns it to a variable automatically.
This is different from the creation of other objects - such as strings and integers - which can be created on the fly,
without assigning them to a variable.

The same is possible with functions, provided that they are created using lambda syntax.
Functions created this way are known as anonymous(ناشناس).

This approach is most commonly used when passing a simple function as an argument to another function.
The syntax is shown in the next example and consists of the lambda keyword followed by a list of arguments,
a colon, and the expression to evaluate and return.
